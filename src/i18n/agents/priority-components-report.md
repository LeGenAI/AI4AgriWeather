## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1 - Critical User Journey (Week 1)**
   - AuthForm: All authentication-related strings
   - AgriOnboarding: Error messages and navigation

2. **Phase 2 - Core Forms (Week 2)**
   - AgriOnboarding: All form labels and placeholders
   - AgriOnboarding: Select options for roles, languages, regions

3. **Phase 3 - Completion (Week 3)**
   - AgriOnboarding: Summary section
   - AgriOnboarding: Benefits and next steps
   - Testing and validation

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create translation keys for both components
   - Update components to use `useTranslation` hook
   - Add translations for all 6 supported languages

2. **Translation Requirements**
   - English (en) - Base language
   - Korean (ko) - Need professional translation
   - Swahili (sw) - Priority for African users
   - French (fr) - For West African users
   - Nepali (ne) - For South Asian users
   - Uzbek (uz) - For Central Asian users

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Test authentication flow in all languages
   - Verify onboarding process with different locales
   - Ensure all form validations work with translated text

## Technical Recommendations

1. **Use nested translation keys** for better organization
2. **Implement fallback values** for missing translations
3. **Add language detection** based on user's browser settings
4. **Create reusable translation components** for common patterns
5. **Set up translation validation** in the CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The AuthForm and AgriOnboarding components are critical entry points for the AI4AgriWeather application. With 152 hardcoded strings between them, proper internationalization is essential for supporting the diverse user base across different regions and languages. The structured approach outlined in this report will ensure a smooth and comprehensive i18n implementation.
